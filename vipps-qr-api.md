# Vipps Vipps QR API v1

ðŸ’¥ DRAFT: This is unfinished work and subject to change. ðŸ’¥

The Vipps QR API lets merchants generate Vipps QR codes that can be used to pay
over the counter, without requiring the Vipps user to provide their telephone
number to the merchant.

The QR code, when scanned and opened, will redirect the user to the Vipps
landing page which on the phone will automatically trigger a switch to the
Vipps app where they can pay the merchant.

API version: 1.0.0.

Document version 1.0.1.

# Basic flow

1. Initiate a Vipps eCom payment
2. Receive the payment URL as response
3. Post the payment URL to the QR API
4. Receive a URL to a QR code i PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format

# Getting Started

## Before you begin

This section covers the quick steps for getting started with the Vipps QR API.
This document assumes you have signed up as a organisation with Vipps and have
retrieved your API credentials for
[the Vipps test environment](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-test-environment.md)
from
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no).

## 1. Authentication
```bash
curl https://apitest.vipps.no/accessToken/get \
-H "client_id: YOUR-CLIENT-ID" \
-H "client_secret: YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY" \
-X POST
```

In response you will get a body with the following schema.
The property `access_token` should be used for all other API requests in the
`Authorization` header as the Bearer token.

```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": "3599",
  "ext_expires_in": "3599",
  "expires_on": "1614116654",
  "not_before": "1614112754",
  "resource": "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000",
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Im5PbzNaRH <snip>"
  }
}
```

See more about
[access token](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md#get-an-access-token)
in the
[Getting Started guide](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md).

## 2. Creating the QR code

Before creating the QR code an eCom payment needs to be created as described in the
[eCom API guide](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api.md#initiate-payment-flow-phone-and-browser).

The
[`POST:/ecomm/v2/payments`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps%20eCom%20API/initiatePaymentV3UsingPOST)
endpoint will return a response like this (the `url` is truncated, but the format is correct):

```json
{
  "orderId": "acme-shop-123-order123abc",
  "url": "https://api.vipps.no/dwo-api-application/v1/deeplink/vippsgateway?v=2&token=eyJraWQiOiJqd3RrZXkiLC <snip>"
}
```

Be aware that the URL is only valid for a short period of time. See the
[eCom API guide](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api.md)
for details.

Afterwards the QR code can be created by using the following endpoint:
[`POST:qrâ€‹/v1/`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-qr-api/#/QR/generateQr)

HTTP Header   | Value
------------  | -------------
Authorization | Bearer `<accesstoken>`
Accept        | image/png

Body:
```json
{
  "url": "https://api.vipps.no/dwo-api-application/v1/deeplink/vippsgateway?v=2&token=eyJraWQiOiJqd3RrZXkiLC <snip>"
}
```

Which will generate a response like this:

```json
{
  "url":"https://qr.vipps.no/generate/qr.png?uri=https://short.vipps.no/v1/url?id=01660693bd8f4311a47ffe4c823fb42a&qr-only=true","expiresIn":60
}
```

The `qr.vipps.no/generate/qr.png` endpoint will generate the QR code as a PNG file with a `short.vipps.no` URL.
The `short.vipps.no` URL is a shortened URL that will redirect to the payment URL that was posted to the API.

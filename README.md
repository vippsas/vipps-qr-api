# Vipps Vipps QR API v1

ðŸ’¥ DRAFT: This is unfinished work and subject to change. ðŸ’¥

This repository contains developer resources for the Vipps QR API.

The Vipps QR API lets merchants generate Vipps QR codes that can be used to pay
over the counter, without requiring the Vipps user to provide their telephone
number to the merchant.

The QR code, when scanned and opened, will redirect the user to the Vipps
landing page which on the phone will automatically trigger a switch to the
Vipps app where they can pay the merchant.
